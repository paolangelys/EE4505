### Matlab Homework 1 Codes 

```HW1_general.m``` presents the basic code utilized for the analysis of the step response of a third order system with a finite zero

The subsequent four files with the format ```HW1_[parameter].m``` include the complementary codes for each parameter in particular analyzed in this assignment (natural frequency, damping ratio, constant 'a', additional pole) with an array of different test values as input for the specified parameter.
